Here’s a simple and practical conversation flow based on your approach:


---

You:
Hey everyone, today we’ll discuss Kafka Schema Registry and Schema Compatibility—just the essential points to understand how it works and why it matters.


---

✅ 1. What is Schema Compatibility?

Schema compatibility is a safety guard that prevents us from registering breaking schema changes in Kafka. It ensures producers can't push incompatible changes that may break consumers.


---

✅ 2. What is Schema Evolution?

Schema evolution is how we change the schema over time while keeping both old and new consumers working without issues.


---

(Show the screenshot of compatibility types in Schema Registry)

You:
These are the main compatibility levels:

None – No restrictions; any schema change is allowed (risky).

Backward – New messages must be readable by old consumers (safest for long-running consumers).

Forward – Old messages must be readable by new consumers (safe if new consumers expect old data).



---

✅ 3. Hands-On Demo: How Compatibility Works

Step 1: Start with "none" compatibility.

1. I’ll produce a message with this initial schema (Version 1):



{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "User",
  "fields": [
    { "name": "id", "type": "int" },
    { "name": "name", "type": "string" }
  ]
}

2. Since compatibility is none, Kafka will register the schema without any checks.




---

Step 2: Add a new mandatory field and switch to "backward."

1. Now, I’m adding a new field without a default:



{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "User",
  "fields": [
    { "name": "id", "type": "int" },
    { "name": "name", "type": "string" },
    { "name": "email", "type": "string" }  // New required field
  ]
}

2. I’ve changed the compatibility to backward—which means old consumers must still work.


3. Result: Kafka rejects this schema because the new mandatory field breaks backward compatibility—old consumers won’t know how to handle the email field.




---

Step 3: Change to "forward" and try again.

1. Let’s switch to forward compatibility—which allows new consumers to read old messages.


2. Now, I’ll try to register the schema again.


3. Result: This time, Kafka accepts the schema, and I can produce new messages.




---

✅ 4. What About Consumers and Multiple Schema Versions?

You:
Now, if a consumer was built when we only had Version 1, it may fail to read messages using Version 2—especially since the email field is mandatory.

This part—how consumers handle schema versions—is something we’ll explore further because it involves how Kafka dynamically fetches schemas when consuming.


---

✅ 5. Summary So Far

1. Compatibility is a guard—it prevents us from registering schemas that break consumers.


2. With none, any change is allowed—but it’s risky.


3. Backward protects old consumers but blocks breaking changes (like mandatory fields).


4. Forward allows new fields but might break old consumers.



I’ve shown how Kafka blocks or allows schema changes based on the compatibility level. Next, we’ll dive deeper into how consumers handle multiple schema versions.
