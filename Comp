Here’s a real-time conversation guide to help you explain Kafka schema compatibility and registry concepts clearly to your team:


---

You:
Hey everyone, today we’ll dive into Kafka Schema Registry, how schema compatibility works, and why it matters for ensuring our consumers don’t break when we evolve our schema.

Right now, we’re running with compatibility set to "none", meaning any schema change is allowed. While this gives us freedom, it’s also risky. If we make a breaking change, any consumer that’s not updated could fail to deserialize messages.

I’ve set up Kafka, Kafka UI, and Apicurio Schema Registry, and we’ll walk through some hands-on examples soon—but first, let’s get the core concepts down.


---

✅ 1. What is Kafka Schema Registry?

You:
In simple terms, Schema Registry is like a library that stores the structure (schema) of the messages we produce. Every message we send to Kafka is linked to a schema version stored in the registry.

When a consumer reads a message, it looks up the schema from the registry (by the schema ID embedded in the message) to deserialize it correctly.

Why is this important? Imagine if a producer adds a new field without informing consumers—if the consumer doesn’t understand that new structure, it can fail.


---

✅ 2. How Schema Compatibility Works

You:
Schema compatibility acts like a gatekeeper—it prevents us from registering new schemas that might break existing consumers.

Here are the main types:

1. Backward Compatibility – Old consumers can read new messages.

Safe when we add optional fields (with defaults).



2. Forward Compatibility – New consumers can read old messages.

Safe when we remove fields or add defaults.



3. Full (Transitive) – Ensures compatibility across all schema versions, not just the previous one.


4. None – No checks—anything goes, but high risk of breaking consumers.



Right now, we’re using "none", meaning any schema change is allowed, but we’re exploring these compatibility levels to protect our consumers.


---

✅ 3. Why Compatibility Matters (A Real-Life Example)

You:
Let’s say we have a User schema:

Version 1 (v1 schema) – Our initial schema:

{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "User",
  "fields": [
    { "name": "id", "type": "int" },
    { "name": "name", "type": "string" }
  ]
}

Now, imagine we add a new field:

Version 2 (v2 schema) – We add a new mandatory field:

{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "User",
  "fields": [
    { "name": "id", "type": "int" },
    { "name": "name", "type": "string" },
    { "name": "email", "type": "string" } // Required, no default
  ]
}

If we try to register this with Backward Compatibility enabled—it will fail, because older consumers don’t expect the new email field and cannot deserialize it.


---

✅ 4. What Happens When Consumers Read Messages?

You:
Here’s how it works:

1. Each message in Kafka includes a schema ID.


2. When a consumer reads a message, it:

Fetches the schema from the registry (or cache).

Uses that schema to deserialize the message.




So, even if we update the schema, consumers don’t break immediately—they only fail if they can’t interpret the new structure.


---

✅ 5. What Happens If a Consumer is Down During a Schema Change?

You:
Imagine a consumer is offline when we evolve the schema. When it comes back:

If Backward Compatibility is enabled—it works (because new fields are optional or have defaults).

With None (our current setting)—it might break if it encounters unknown or mandatory fields.


This is why Backward Compatibility is the safest option when you have long-running consumers.


---

✅ 6. Hands-On Demo (What We’ll Try Today)

You:
To make this real, I’ve set up:

Kafka (message broker)

Kafka UI (to monitor topics)

Apicurio Schema Registry (to manage schemas)

Producer & Consumer (to send and receive messages)


Here’s what we’ll do:

1. Start with "none" compatibility – We’ll publish a message.


2. Try a breaking schema change – Add a required field without defaults.


3. Enable Backward Compatibility – See how it prevents us from breaking older consumers.


4. Simulate an old consumer – Watch it fail if it cannot read a new schema.




---

You:
By the end, we’ll understand:

1. How schema changes affect consumers.


2. How Backward and Forward Compatibility protect us.


3. Why we should move away from None Compatibility to avoid surprises.
