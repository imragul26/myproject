Hope you're doing well and wishing you a speedy recovery. We are currently working on consuming a SOAP service. The original SOAP service URL is accessible and works perfectly when we try to access it through SoapUI. However, when we try to access the same service from our application after deployment in dev, it throws a 503 Service Unavailable error. We suspect that this might be related to the TLS configuration with the DestinationRule. In our previous experience with the Saxo project, we used an Envoy filter to handle TLS renegotiation issues, as Istio’s DestinationRule didn’t allow it. We’ve added the Envoy filter, but we’re uncertain about which certificate to include in the tls_certificates chain. Could you please guide us on how to proceed?"
I found this Jira Cloud app in Teams and have been using it for the past couple of days. It’s pretty useful—you can track issues, get notifications, and update Jira tickets without leaving Teams. Thought I’d share it here in case anyone wants to try it out.
