Scenario: Handling Failures in Cash Transfer Service

1. Service Overview:

A cash transfer service has endpoints and asynchronous internal processes.

When an endpoint is triggered to initiate a transfer, the request is saved, the internal process is triggered, and a response is sent back indicating initiation.



2. Issue:

Internal processes may fail to connect to external systems (e.g., endpoints or AMQ), causing incomplete operations.



3. Proposed Solution:

Update Record on Failure:

When an internal process fails, mark the record as failed.

Introduce a new column (e.g., retry_flag) with default value N (No). Set it to Y (Yes) for failed records.


Retry Mechanism:

Implement a timer to check for records with retry_flag = Y every 15 minutes.

Once a record is picked, set retry_flag back to N to prevent duplicate processing.


Reprocessing Logic:

Attempt to reprocess the record.

If successful, no further action is required.

If it fails again, set retry_flag to Y for another retry after 15 minutes.

Let me know if this captures your idea or if any adjustments are needed.
The source and destination for the endpoint are as follows: [include details here]. Initially, the default timeout for the response was set to 3 minutes. However, keeping the connection open for that long is not optimal. To address this, we reduced the timeout to 45 seconds. If a response is not received within this time frame, our application will throw a SocketException."
, the default timeout was set to 3 minutes. However, even with this 3-minute timeout, we were not receiving the response within that time, meaning the response was taking longer than expected. As keeping the connection open for such a long period was not ideal, we decided to reduce the timeout to 45 seconds. If the response is not received within this new timeframe, a SocketException is thrown by our application."
