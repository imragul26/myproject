Subject: Request for Dev Environment Access Next Week

Dear [Client's Name/Team],

The mock service is now reconnected and available in the dev, test, and UAT environments. However, as we continue to finalize our fixes, we will need access to the dev environment for testing next week. Could you confirm if this would work with minimal impact on your side?

Best regards,
