Yes, I completely agree! Bumrah's delivery to dismiss Konstas was a masterstrokeâ€”perfectly executed and a testament to his skill. At the same time, I must say, Konstas really impressed me with his composure on such a massive occasion like Boxing Day. To perform with such intent and help set the tone for a total of over 460 in front of that huge crowd was remarkable. He truly rose to the occasion!"
