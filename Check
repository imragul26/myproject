Scenario: Handling Failures in Cash Transfer Service

1. Service Overview:

A cash transfer service has endpoints and asynchronous internal processes.

When an endpoint is triggered to initiate a transfer, the request is saved, the internal process is triggered, and a response is sent back indicating initiation.



2. Issue:

Internal processes may fail to connect to external systems (e.g., endpoints or AMQ), causing incomplete operations.



3. Proposed Solution:

Update Record on Failure:

When an internal process fails, mark the record as failed.

Introduce a new column (e.g., retry_flag) with default value N (No). Set it to Y (Yes) for failed records.


Retry Mechanism:

Implement a timer to check for records with retry_flag = Y every 15 minutes.

Once a record is picked, set retry_flag back to N to prevent duplicate processing.


Reprocessing Logic:

Attempt to reprocess the record.

If successful, no further action is required.

If it fails again, set retry_flag to Y for another retry after 15 minutes.
