Please find the JWT assertion attached to this email as a file.

Regarding your second question about the available accounts accessible with this assertion, we will check and get back to you shortly.
As for the accounts accessible to view the transfer limits using this token, we will review and provide clarification shortly.
We paused the mock service to address some critical functionality tests on our end. While the mock service supports your testing, it has limited our ability to validate and troubleshoot our own functionality effectively.

We’re working to complete these tests quickly and will reconnect the mock service as soon as possible. Thank you for your understand
Subject: Request for Dev Environment Access Next Week

Dear [Client's Name/Team],

The mock service is now reconnected and available in the dev, test, and UAT environments. However, as we continue to finalize our fixes, we will need access to the dev environment for testing next week. Could you confirm if this would work with minimal impact on your side?

We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work through this process.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

We have implemented a redelivery mechanism to handle responses that take longer than 3 minutes, cutting the connection and retrying. Although this has helped reduce the log entries, the issue is not fully resolved.

Thank you for your follow-up. As requested, we have attached the timestamps of our requests (in UTC) for your reference.

To provide further insight, requests and responses typically occur within seconds. However, in some cases, the responses take longer than expected. The request flow is configured with a maximum timeout of 45 seconds, retrying every 3 seconds. After 2-3 retries, we receive the response, confirming that the requests are reaching your endpoint despite initial delays.

We hope this information helps with your investigation. Please let us know if any further details are required.
We encountered an issue where:

1. AdviceWith was not replacing endpoints (e.g., S3) in the test cases.


2. The direct route created by the code generator (rest().to("direct:route1")) was not being hit when invoked using the ProducerTemplate.



Fix:
We introduced an intermediary route:

rest().to("direct:route1")

from("direct:route1").to("direct:route2")

from("direct:route2").to("aws2-s3:bucket-name")


After this change, both AdviceWith replacement and ProducerTemplate invocation started working correctly.

This doesn’t seem like the correct fix long-term, but does this help you identify what the root cause might be or remind you of anything related? Let me know your thoughts!
